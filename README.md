# CMPG315_TEXT_MESSAGING_APP
This is the repository for all the code needed to ensure a successful implementation of a TCP Client-Server setup.
Technologies used to develop the text messaging app, both client and server apps, was Visual Studio Code 2022, Playit.gg and C#. The applications were developed using the .NET framework, thus requiring a Windows operating system to function. The applications require a running internet connection for client server communication and there are no installation requirements, they are standalone applications executable by running the .exe files. The server however needs to be on the machine which was used to create the tunnel connection on Playit.gg, since Playit.gg routes the incoming connection requests of the given shared IP Address to that specific machine hosting the serverâ€™s port. The server then listens on the port for incoming connection requests and accept those connection and authenticate them.
